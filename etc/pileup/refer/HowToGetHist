 Pileup JSON Files For Run II
pileupCalc.py -i Cert_XXX_json.txt --inputLumiJSON pileup_latest.txt  --calcMode true --minBiasXsec 69200 --maxPileupBin 50 --numPileupBins 50  MyDataPileupHistogram.root

for 2016 files are at : 
/afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSCOMM/COMM_DQM/certification/Collisions16/13TeV/PileUp/
The most up-to-date is linked to pileup_latest.txt. 
The Pileup JSON will be updated regularly in the future.

 Note that the cross-section value is 69 mb for 2015 and 69.2 mb for 2016. 
 Note that the recommended minBias cross-section of 80mb for reweighting is currently under review. The best-fit value is determined to be 69.2 mb with an uncertainty of 4.6% Since all analysis JSON`s should only include subsets of Runs and LS`s of the DCS-Only JSON, you in principle do not have to calculate the pile up JSON yourself. Instead, use your specific JSON to mask the pile up JSON provided centrally, as in shown in the example above. 
 If you want to anyhow calculate the pileup per LS yourself, you can use the script at /afs/cern.ch/user/l/lumipro/public/estimatePileup_makeJSON_2015.py.
